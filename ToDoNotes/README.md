The latest , my fourth app , it is a utility tool , ToDoNotes . Through this app , you can make sticky notes , to make a list of things you want to do.I have used javascript's local storage API , to implement this app.
You can even prioritize your work by putting them in differently coloured notes . As you are done with that particular work , you just have to touch that note just once , it will be deleted .
