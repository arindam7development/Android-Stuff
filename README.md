Project Info 


The name of this app is RitchieGosling ,based on two great computer scientist . 
This is a basic android application , mainly showing the implications of different layouts for different android devices.

My second project is a game . It is a TicTacToe game for all android devices.'x' will be the for user and '0' will be for Android.I have used javascript , webviews . Inside the TicTacToe folder you will find Manifest.xml file  , MainActivity.java file . The main logic of the game is embedded in html as an android asset. 
You can install the .apk file on your device to test.

My third project WebpageIntoAnApp (with Integrated Game) , is an integration of (Jabberwocky) poem ,  music , webpages and last but not the least a ROUND BALL GAME . All these four things are integrated through different activities .This was the most interesting part during the development of this app.

So you can listen a poem with little music , read some webpages , meet the character (the beast about which the poem is all about) of the poem  and you can play ROUND BALL GAME. 

The latest my fourth app , it is a utility tool , ToDoNotes . Through this app , you can make sticky notes , to make a list of things you want to do. You can even prioritize your work by putting them in differently coloured notes . As you are done with that particular work , you just have to touch that note , it will be deleted .
